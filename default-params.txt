## Parameter file for bacteria simulation

## Blank lines and lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored
## It's important that the order of the data-holding lines is respected
## Booleans must be entered as 1 for True, 0 for False

## General parameters

# Size of the grid (along each dimension)
100

# Number of cycles to simulate
10000

# Global growth multiplier
1.0

# Global death rate
0.002

# Are all bacteria subject to the death rate, even if they're
# at a food source?
1

########################################
## Simulation output

# Report simulation progress to screen?
1

# Filename for log
run.log

# Filename for data output
run.dat

# Number of iterations between data outputs
1

########################################
## Strains specification

# Number of strains to read from file
37

# Filename of the strains file
# This file must have one strain per line with the following fields
# separated by whitespace:
# id (ignored) | strain name | growth chance | receiver degree | sender degree
strains.dat

########################################
## Antagonisms

# Enable antagonisms?
1

# Filename of the antagonisms table
# (ignored if antagonisms are disabled, but don't leave blank!)
antagonisms.dat

########################################
## Growth model

# Should we use the growth rates from the strains data file?
# If false, will compute them using their sender degrees
# (use_real_growth)
0

# If the above is false, specify the linear relation between
# growth rate and sender degree, which is of the form:
#   growth_rate = growth_intercept + sender_degree*growth_slope

# growth_intercept (i.e. growth rate at sender degree 0)
# (ignored if use_real_growth is false, but don't leave blank)
0.2582 

# growth_slope (should generally be negative)
# (ignored if use_real_growth is false, but don't leave blank)
-0.0025

########################################
## Food sources

# Rations of new food source
200

# Radius of each food source
5.0

# Food source spawn rate
0.2

## Starting conditions

# Starting population, per strain
100

# Starting number of food sources
